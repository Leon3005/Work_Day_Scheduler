# Work Day Scheduler - HW05

## Description

For this assignment I had to use JavaScript frameworks such as Moment (for the live date and hour format), and jQuery. Moment was used at the top of the page where the current date is displayed and will change in real time. It was also used to add AM and PM to the time blocks. The time blocks were created using jQuery and template strings, so that when the page loads, the times and inputs are dynamically created.

The user score is based on how much time they have remaining.
